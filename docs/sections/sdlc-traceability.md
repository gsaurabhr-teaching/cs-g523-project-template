## Development Process

The project follows a V-model inspired development process,
emphasizing early verification planning and continuous validation.

Key phases include:
- Requirements analysis
- Architectural design
- Detailed design and implementation
- Verification and validation

## Traceability

Each requirement is traced to:
- Architectural elements
- Software modules
- Test cases

Traceability ensures that all requirements are implemented
and verified systematically.

## Verification Planning

Verification activities are planned alongside design activities
to ensure testability and early detection of defects.
