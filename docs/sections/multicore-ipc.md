The system targets a multicore platform
with explicit partitioning of responsibilities across cores.

## Inter-Process Communication

IPC mechanisms include:
- Message queues
- Shared memory with synchronization
- Event notifications

## Design Challenges

- Avoiding race conditions
- Ensuring data consistency
- Bounding communication latency
